## Project Overview
AirTouch is an innovative gesture control system that enables users to interact with their computers using intuitive hand gestures. This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI
to track hand movements through a webcam, translating them into cursor movements and mouse clicks. The system is designed to recognize specific gestures like hand orientation and finger positions for 
various controls, including opening web pages.

## Setup
Dependencies: Python 3, openCV-pthon, mediapipe ( relevant for python interpreter 9-11), pyAutoGUI.
Install dependencies using pip install opencv-python, mediapipe, pyautogui.

## Running the Program
Execute python AirTouch.py in your terminal. Ensure your webcam is unobstructed and well-lit.

## Usage:
Move the cursor: Point with your index finger.  
Right Click: Bring the thumb and index finger close together.  
Left Click: Double action of thumb and index finger coming close.  
Open Google: Flip your hand showing back side to the camera.
